 # Quantum Computing Projects: Bloch Sphere & Grover's Algorithm

This repository contains implementations of two fundamental quantum computing concepts: **Bloch Sphere Visualization** and **Grover's Algorithm**. These examples demonstrate key ideas in quantum computation and can be run using Qiskit.

## 1. Bloch Sphere Visualization

The **Bloch Sphere** is a powerful visualization tool used to represent the state of a qubit in quantum computing. Unlike classical bits, qubits can exist in superposition, meaning they can be in a combination of the states |0⟩ and |1⟩ simultaneously. The Bloch Sphere represents this superposition as a point on the surface of a 3D sphere, allowing us to visualize the qubit's behavior in a more intuitive way.

### Key Points:
- **Qubit States**: Represented as points on the Bloch Sphere.
- **Superposition**: The state of the qubit is a combination of |0⟩ and |1⟩, expressed as a vector.
- **Visualization**: The state vector's orientation changes based on quantum gates applied to the qubit.

In this repository, we demonstrate the visualization of a qubit's state that lies 45 degrees from the |1⟩ state and 135 degrees from the |0⟩ state. The output is a Bloch Sphere diagram that helps in visualizing this quantum state.

## 2. Grover's Algorithm

**Grover's Algorithm** is a quantum algorithm designed to search for a specific item in an unsorted database with quadratic speedup compared to classical algorithms. In classical computing, searching through an unsorted list takes linear time, but Grover's Algorithm can find the item in just O(√N) time, where N is the number of items.

### Key Points:
- **Problem**: Searching for a specific state in an unsorted quantum database.
- **Oracle**: Identifies the target state.
- **Diffusion Operator**: Amplifies the probability of measuring the correct state.
- **Quantum Speedup**: Quadratic improvement over classical search algorithms.

In this repository, we implement Grover's Algorithm using 2 qubits to search for one of four possible states. The target state is marked using an oracle, and the algorithm amplifies the probability of finding the correct state. The circuit is then simulated, and the results show how the target state emerges with high probability, which is visualized using a histogram.
